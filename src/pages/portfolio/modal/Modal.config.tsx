        <Typography variant='body1' >This app was built mobile-first. I engage with web content primarily through my laptop I realize that can influence my layout planning. So for this project, I started with mobile and then scaled it to larger screens. This led to using a more card-based approach.</Typography><br />

        <Typography variant='body1' >My intention with this project was to highlight my front-end skills. There was some interesting challenges with the data (collection, processing and algorithm development), but didn"â€™"t want to make that too central to this addition to my portfolio.</Typography><br />

        <Typography variant='body1' >So, I went with a small data set and only four variables with which the user can interact with the data. I could see at some point coming back to this app, adding a backend, expanding the dataset to encompass most US cities (including towns under 50,000) and increasing the variable choices to include things like cost of living, religiosity, commute times, etc. This is a very scalable project.</Typography><br />

        <Typography variant='body1' >The UI was built with React.js. This was my first project using Affinity products instead of Adobe Creative. I built the wireframes using Publisher and the images (logos and icons) with Photo and Designer. I did the webscrapping and data processing in Node.js.</Typography><br />

        <Typography variant='body1' >A quick note on UX: In designing the sliders for selecting variable ranges, I intentionally left out quantifying feedback like tick markers or popups on the handles that gave a specific number or party range. I wanted it to be more a "feel" experience than a "think" experience.</Typography><br />
